GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WARNING: For Python beginners:
the instructions here will only make sense after you have gone through and
completed the training materials.

1. WHICH PART TO CHANGE?: Uncomment every line with  [YOUR CODE HERE] and replace it with your code.
Please don't change anything else other than these lines.

2. USE OF JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: For those who would like to use Jupyter Notebook. You can copy and paste
each function in the notebook environment, test your code their. However,
remember to paste back your code in a .py file and ensure that its running
okay.

3. IDENTATION: Please make sure that you check your identation

4. Returning things frm function: All the functions below have to return a value.
Please dont forget to use the return statement to return a value.

5. HINTS: please read my comments for hints and instructions where applicable
